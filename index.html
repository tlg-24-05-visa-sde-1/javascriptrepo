      <p>Wikipedia says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion by which humans and other
        animals move rapidly on foot. Running is a gait with an aerial phase in
        which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This
        is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the
        ground, the legs are kept mostly straight, and the center of gravity
        vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.
